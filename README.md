# setup_notes
The setup notes, served as a personal reference for myself, describes how I setup my developer environment on macOS big
Sur. 

This document desribes how I sestup my developer environment on macOS Big Sur. 

Contributing: If you find any mistakes in the steps describe below, or if any
of the commands are outdated, do let me know. 

## CLI - Command Line Developer Tools for Xcode

Important dependency before Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Developer
Tools** for Xcode. These includes compilers that will allow you to build things
from source. Install CLI directly on the terminal:

```bash
xcode-select install
```

## Homebrew 

Once CLI is installed, we can install Homebrew. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is
the missing package manager for macOS (or Linux). 


Paste the following in a macOS Terminal or Linux shell prompt. 
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## git setup

### Connecting to Github with ssh on MacOS

Follow the order of steps in order to setup Python.


## Python build dependencies

<a name="install_pyenv">For `pyenv` to install Python correctly, required to install the Python build
dependencies.</a>

1. Install [Python build dependencies](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment) before attempting to install a new Python
   version.

**Notes**: Highly recommend to install Python build dependencies before any
installation with Python and its related modules. 

```bash
# optional, but recommended:
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
```


## Install Python using `pyenv`
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) stands for Python environment. `pyenv` lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

According to the [pyenv guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macos): 

2. Install `pyenv` via Homebrew by running:

```bash
brew install pyenv
````
Also install [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)
like `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`, which we'll need later. 

**Technical details**: Every time you execute a Python script or use pip, pyenv works in the background to intercept that command and send it to the Python environment that is currently activated. It does this using shims on the PATH environment variable, which allow Python-related commands to be dynamically rerouted.


3. Define environment variable PYENV_ROOT to point to the path where pyenv repo is cloned and add $PYENV_ROOT/bin to your $PATH for access to the pyenv command-line utility.

For bash:
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```
For Ubuntu Desktop:
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
For Zsh:
```zsh
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
````

4. Add pyenv init to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion. Please make sure eval "$(pyenv init -)" is placed toward the end of the shell configuration file since it manipulates PATH during the initialization.

```bash
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bash_profile
```
- **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.
- **fish note**: Use `pyenv init - | source` instead of `eval (pyenv init -)`.
- **Ubuntu and Fedora note**: Modify your `~/.bashrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`

**General warning**: There are some systems where the `BASH_ENV` variable is configured to point to `.bashrc`. On such systems you should almost certainly put the above mentioned line `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` into `.bash_profile`, and not into `.bashrc`. Otherwise you may observe strange behaviour, such as pyenv getting into an infinite loop. See [#264](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/264) for details.

5. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect. You can now begin using pyenv
```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```
6. Install Python version

```bash
pyenv install 3.9.1 #Install Python version 3.9.1
pyenv install 3.7.2 #Install Python version 3.7.2
pyenv versions # List all Python versions installed
````
### Locating the Python Installation

Each Python version is installed into its own directory under `$(pyenv root)/versions`.

For example, you might have these versions installed:

- `$(pyenv root)/versions/2.7.8/`
- `$(pyenv root)/versions/3.9.1/`
- `$(pyenv root)/versions/pypy-2.4.0/`

As far as pyenv is concerned, version names are simply the directories in `$(pyenv root)/versions`.



### Uninstalling Python Versions 

As time goes on, you will accumulate Python versions in your `$(pyenv root)/versions` directory.

To remove old Python versions, `pyenv uninstall` command to automate the removal process.

Alternatively, simply `rm -rf` the directory of the version you want to remove. You can find the directory of a particular Python version with the `pyenv prefix` command, e.g. `pyenv prefix 2.6.8.`

### Upgrading pyenv 

If you've installed pyenv using homebrew, upgrade using:
```bash
brew upgrade pyenv
```

If you've installed pyenv using the instructions above, you can upgrade your installation at any time using git.

To upgrade to the latest development version of pyenv, use git pull:
```bash
cd $(pyenv root)
git pull
```
To upgrade to a specific release of pyenv, check out the corresponding tag:
```bash
cd $(pyenv root)
git fetch
git tag
git checkout v0.1.0
```


## Install Python package manager and setup tools 

### pip 
According to [pip manual](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#install-pip), pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or PYthon 3 >= 3.4 downloaded from [python.org](python.org) or if you are working in a virtual environment created by virtualenv or venv. Just make sure to upgrade pip. 

Check if pip is already installed: 
```bash
python -m pip --version 
```


### Installing pip with get-pip.py

Download get-pip.py
```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

Install pip 
```bash
python get-pip.py
```

### Upgrade setuptools and pip

Setuptools can be updated via pip3, without having to re-brew Python 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

pip3 can be used to upgrade itself via: 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```



### pip install fails for every package
According to [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49748063/pip-install-fails-for-every-package-could-not-find-a-version-that-satisfies/49748494#49748494)

Error: 

`pip install <package name>` is failing for every package for me. This is what I get:

```
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement <package-name>
Not matching distribution found for <package-name>
```
Fix: 


Upgrade pip as follows:
```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
```

The detailed description can be found in the [link](https://bhch.github.io/posts/2017/04/fix-the-pip-error-couldnt-find-a-version-that-satisfies-the-requirement/) shared by Anupam in the comments.

Note: You may need to use sudo python above if not in a virtual environment.


Lastly, to avoid other install errors, make sure you also upgrade setuptools after doing the above:

```bash
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```
### Install pipx 

`pipx` enables you to
- Expose CLI entrypoints of packages ("apps") installed to isolated environments with the install command. This guarantees no dependency conflicts and clean uninstalls!
- Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages that were installed with pipx
- Run the latest version of a Python application in a temporary environment with the `run` command
- Best of all, pipx runs with regular user permissions, never calling `sudo pip install` (you aren't doing that, are you? ðŸ˜„).

On macOS:
```bash
brew install pipx 
pipx ensurepath 
```
And, upgrade `pipx` 

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade pipx
```

Otherwise, install via `pip`

```bath
python3 -m pip install --user pipx 
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Upgrade `pipx` :
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user -U pipx
```

Shell completions are available by the following instructions printed with this
command.

```bash
pipx completions
```
### Install a package and its applications with pipx

You can globally install an application by running 
```bash
pipx install PACKAGE
```

This automatically creates a virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package's associated applications (entry points) to a location on your PATH. 
For example, `pipx install pycowsay` makes the `pycowsay` command available globally, but sandboxes the pycowsay package in its own virtual environment. **`pipx` never needs to run as `sudo` to do this**.

## Setup Python Virtual Environment Settings

### [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is required before installing `virtualenv`. <a href="#install_pyenv">See above installing
`pyenv`.</a>


### [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
Short for "virtual environment." This manages separate directories for the modules you install (e.g., with `pip`). That way, each virtual environment can have it's own set of installed modules that is walled off from every other virtual environment so they don't interfere with each other. Like with `pyenv`, we'll switch virtual environments with virtualenvwrapper's `workon` command (as described later).



Install virtualenv. If no `pipx`, try `pip install virtualenv`
```bash
pipx install virtualenv
```

**Technical details:** `virtualenv` keeps each environment (and its installed modules) in separate folders; therefore, each is like a silo that doesn't interact with any other virtual environment. Usually, the exact file location is defined by the user, but we can use virtualenvwrapper to instead handle this for us.


### [`virtualenvwrapper`](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) pyenv plugin to manage virtual environment 


This helps pyenv and virtualenv gel like PB&J. With it, you can effectively switch between a single environment that has both the Python version and virtual environment wrapped in one bundle. **Make sure `pyenv` and `virtualenv` are installed before you install this wrapper**.


Try using `pip` if no `pipx` 
```bash
pipx install virtualenvwrapper
```

`pyenv-virtualenvwrapper` is a `pyenv` plugin to manage your `virtualenvs` with
`virtualenvwrapper`. 

Then extend the usage of `pyenv` by install the `pyenv-virtualenvwrapper`:
```bash
brew update
brew install pyenv-virtualenvwrapper
```

Append the following to `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
export PYENV_VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PREFER_PYVENV="true"
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
pyenv virtualenvwrapper_lazy
```
Reload the shell:
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Commmand usage

Using `mkvirtualenv` to make a virtual environment `venv_test`
```bash
mkvirtualenv venv_test
```

Switch between virtual environment using `deactivate` and `workon` commands. 
```bash
deactivate
workon venv_test
(ven_test) $ 
```

Notes: 
- `virtualenvwrapper_lazy` [decrease shell time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11e773/tip_virtualenvwrapper_has_a_lazy_version_you_can/)


## Troubleshooting Python Environment setup issues

### 1. Error finding `virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader`

```bash
Error while finding spec for 'virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader' (<class 'ImportError'>: No module named 'virtualenvwrapper')
virtualenvwrapper.sh: There was a problem running the initialization hooks.
```
The solution also fixed cannot switch python version with `pyenv` using `pyenv
shell` command. 

The solution requires the understanding on [how pyenv works](https://mungingdata.com/python/how-pyenv-works-shims/). 

Stackoverflow reference: [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33216679/usr-bin-python3-error-while-finding-spec-for-virtualenvwrapper-hook-loader)


Background to the problem: **`pyenv` changes `PATH`**
`pyenv` adds this code to the `~/.bash_profile` which changes the `PATH`.

```bash
if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"
fi
```
Run `echo $PATH` to see the `PATH` is different now: 
```bash
/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

`/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims` has been added before all other directories in the
`PATH`. 

All terminal commands will go through `/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims` first now.
This allows pyenv to "intercept" any relevant Python commands. 

- The `python` command will go to `/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims/python`
- The `pip` command will go to `/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims/pip`

**The solution uses the correct path to resolve the issues, and the solution are
follows**:
```bash
$> which -a python 
/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims/python
/usr/bin/python
```
Select the first path which is `/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims/python` or
`~/.pyenv/shims/python`. 

Add the following to `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims/python3
```

Locate the path of `virtualenvwrapper.sh`
```bash
$> pyenv which virtualenvwrapper.sh 
/Users/alvin/.pyenv/versions/3.9.1/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
Add the following to `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
source /Users/alvin/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

The order of addition of fixes into `~/.bash_profile`
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/alvin/.local/bin"
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/Users/alvin/.pyenv/shims/python3

# for virtualenv, Tell pyenv-virtualenvwrapper ti use pyenv when creating new Python environments
export PYENV_VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PREFER_PYVENV="true"

# Setup virtualenv home
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
source ~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"
fi
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

pyenv virtualenvwrapper_lazy
```
### 2. On startup, macOS terminal fails to load `eval "$(pyenv init -)"`

`~/.bash_profile` is not sourced when terminal is start up. 

To fix, add the following to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then
  . ~/.bash_profile
fi

```
